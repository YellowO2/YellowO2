### Hello! I'm Yuxuan.

I'm a Year 3 Computer Engineering student at NTU who enjoys building fun things that are hopefully useful sometimes. Currently, I'm particularly interested in simulating real-life behaviours using code, such as procedural generation or neural networks.

### A Few Things I've Built

I've pinned my favorite projects below, but here are the direct links:

- **[2W2Meet](https://github.com/YellowO2/2w2meet)** - A full-stack group event planner with real-time scheduling and Google Maps integration, built with Vue.js and Firebase.
- **[AI Among Us](https://github.com/YellowO2/ai-among-us)** - A real-time multiplayer social deduction game built with Next.js where players hunt for the AI bots.
- **[Interactive Plant Sim](https://github.com/YellowO2/janky-plant-sim)** - A browser-based physics simulation of a growing plant, powered by Matter.js.
