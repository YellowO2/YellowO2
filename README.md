# Hello! 

[![Typing SVG](https://readme-typing-svg.demolab.com?font=Fira+Code&pause=1000&color=00C4F7&width=435&lines=I'm+Yuxuan+%3A))](https://git.io/typing-svg)

I'm a Year 3 [Computer Engineering student at NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/education/undergraduate-programme/bachelor-of-engineering-in-computer-engineering) who enjoys building fun things that are hopefully useful sometimes. My main experience lies in web development, but I hope my diverse projects reflect my interests and comfort with exploring different technologies.

Currently, I'm particularly interested in simulating interesting behaviours using code, such as procedural generation, neural networks, or LLM.

## Beyond Coding Projects

In the past year, I've been diving into cybersecurity through Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions. It's been a fun, and made me think more about security of my code.
